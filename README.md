# To-Do-list (school challenge)
Add or remove item from the list



### Task list:

```
• the 'add new to-do' button click should create a new <li> and inside it 
  <input> type checkbox and <span> with the content from input field

• checking the checkbox should cross the <span> content (CSS solution)   

• the 'remove from list' button should delete all checked items from the list

• it would be preferable to use the MVC pattern
```
